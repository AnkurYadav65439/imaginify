//tech stack: next-14, typescript, mongodb, stripe, clerk, cloudinary ai, shadcn, tailwind

//CONCEPTS : server actions: like user.action.ts : instead of proper formating as an api  and calling with proper formating
    here we are calling the functions(like getUserById) directly from frontend.
    Also call them with api(like in /api/webhooks/clerk) api endpoint 

//next app
  default options including src-directory: no

//some font and seo changes in layout.tsx 

//copy tailwind.config.ts and globals.css and download public folder from github

//create dorganisational folder structure in app
 and also placed main 'page.tsx' inside (root) to access their layout instead(which is done automatically)

//setup clerk and its env
  NOTE: home page bceomes protected automaticaly after clerk setup. (due to clerkProvider wrapping whole app through main layout)

//customization with clerk -> customization -> branding
  edit clerkprovider with appearances variables for colors etc
  
  
//mongoDB setup 
  IMP: NO express server is used as nextjs is serverless state means there is no persistent connection to server 
    it connectes to server for a request and then disconnects. Provides better scallability and reliability.
    But to optimize it we are going to chached the mongooose connection.(replaced with mysterymessage function github)

    lib->database->mongoose.ts

//lib->actions: for api's, in nextjs its server actions bascially by writing "use server" at top and then your functions

//copied utils(lib) from gith

//Saving user to db after succesfully created by clerk, basically syncing the data from clerk user to user in db by using webhooks
  //webhooks: basically when something happens(once user is signup with clerk), a event is triggered (with payload data) and sends data over Event processing directly to db
  //But we need to deploy to expose our endpoind 

//after deloyment
  clerk->webhooks->add endpoint(deployed url with /api/webhooks/clerk) where your route.ts file is present (bascially your backend endpoint or api to CRUD based on events)
  and select events i.e user , add signing secret to env 
  route.ts file provided by clerk (or gith modified should be used)
  update middleware, public route to /api/webhooks/clerk so that clerk can ping it.

needed svix package for ablove

//After COMPLEX form: setup cloudinary 
  getting started-> npm i next-cloundinary -> env setup with keys and secret and cloud name
  Add new upload preset(unsigned):
  setting->upload->enable unsigned media(if u didn't exceeded limit till now) -> add upload preset -> name, unsigned, folder name -> media analysis ai -> tick google auto tagging, auto tagging to 0.5(slider) -> save
  add add-ons-> clouidnary bg removal ai, google auto tagging(subscribe free plan: limit credit 15, 50/month)
  COMPLETED SETUP

//Now can use cloudinary image  upload widget , image component to upload and optimize view of image
  clduploadwidget with nextjs(refer site) : created MediaUploader.tsx
  npm i next-cloudinary already done
